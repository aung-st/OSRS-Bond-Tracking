# OSRS Bond Tracking

## This project is a bond sales tracker for Old School Runescape with the aim of notifying users when bond sales dip below a user defined threshold so they can save time, money and spend less time casting high alchemy (Unless you are fond of such an activity. No judgement passed here).
